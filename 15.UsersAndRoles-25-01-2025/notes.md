# **Notes on Owner, Reader, and Contributor Roles in Azure**

Azure provides role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to Azure resources. Three key built-in roles are:

#### **1. Owner**
- **Permissions:** Full control of all resources, including the ability to assign access to others.
- **Use Case:** Typically assigned to administrators or individuals who need full control over a subscription or resource group.

#### **2. Contributor**
- **Permissions:** Can create and manage all types of Azure resources but **cannot grant access to others.**
- **Use Case:** Suitable for developers or DevOps engineers who need to manage resources but donâ€™t need to assign permissions.

#### **3. Reader**
- **Permissions:** Can only view resources and their configurations. **No permissions to modify or delete resources.**
- **Use Case:** Best for auditors or team members who need to monitor resources without making changes.
