### Summary of Key Folders in the Linux File System

Here is a concise overview of the main directories in the Linux File System, as per the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**:

1. **`/` (Root Directory)**  
   - The top-level directory that contains all other files and directories in the system.

2. **`/bin`**  
   - Essential binary executables (commands) needed for the system's basic functionality, available for all users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `cat`).

3. **`/boot`**  
   - Contains files needed for booting the system, such as the Linux kernel and initial RAM disk (`initrd`).

4. **`/dev`**  
   - Device files representing hardware (e.g., hard drives, USB devices, terminals). Linux treats devices as files.

5. **`/etc`**  
   - System-wide configuration files and settings for the operating system and installed software (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/fstab`).

6. **`/home`**  
   - User home directories where personal files and user-specific configuration data are stored (e.g., `/home/username`).

7. **`/lib`**  
   - Essential shared libraries and kernel modules required to run binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

8. **`/media`**  
   - Mount point for removable media devices like USB drives, CDs, and DVDs.

9. **`/mnt`**  
   - Temporary mount point for file systems, often used for mounting external storage or network drives.

10. **`/opt`**  
    - Optional software packages and third-party applications not part of the default installation.

11. **`/proc`**  
    - Virtual filesystem providing system and process information (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`).

12. **`/root`**  
    - The home directory for the **root user** (superuser), not to be confused with `/`.

13. **`/sbin`**  
    - System binaries essential for system administration (e.g., `shutdown`, `fsck`), typically used by the root user.

14. **`/srv`**  
    - Data for services provided by the system, like web servers or FTP services (e.g., `/srv/www`).

15. **`/sys`**  
    - Virtual filesystem providing information about the kernel and devices (e.g., `/sys/class`, `/sys/devices`).

16. **`/tmp`**  
    - Temporary files used by the system or applications, often cleared upon reboot.

17. **`/usr`**  
    - User-related programs and data. Subdirectories include:
    - `/usr/bin`: Non-essential user command binaries.
    - `/usr/lib`: Libraries for applications in `/usr/bin`.
    - `/usr/share`: Shared resources like documentation and icons.

18. **`/var`**  
    - Variable data such as log files, mail spools, and application caches (e.g., `/var/log`, `/var/spool`).

These directories provide an organized structure for managing system files, user data, and software in Linux.
